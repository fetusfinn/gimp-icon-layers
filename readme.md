### GIMP 3 Create Scaled .ico Layers
This is a plugin for [GIMP 3](https://www.gimp.org/) that creates up to 4 copies of the selected layer, and scales them to the chosen sizes, so that the image can then be exported to a .ico with the different layers used for the different possible icon sizes.

#### Installation
To install, first locate your plugins folder, this can be done by going to `Edit -> Preferences -> Folders (at the very bottom) -> Plug-ins` and you'll find the paths to the different locations, or you can even add your own. Once you've found the folder, create a new folder inside of it and give it the same name as the script, minus the `.py`, then drop the plugin in it and you're done.

#### Usage
The plugin can be found under `Layer -> Create Icon Layers`.
To use the plugin, just enter the the sizes of the icons you wish to create, and hit OK. 
If you don't want to create all 4 layers, then just toggle them via the checkboxes.
